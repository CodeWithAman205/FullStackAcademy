        <h1>Computer</h1>
        <p>
            A computer is a machine that can be programmed to automatically
            carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations
            (computation). Modern digital electronic computers can perform
            generic sets of operations known as programs. These programs enable
            computers to perform a wide range of tasks. The term computer system
            may refer to a nominally complete computer that includes the
            hardware, operating system, software, and peripheral equipment
            needed and used for full operation.

        <h2>Etymology</h2>
        <p>
            It was not until the mid-20th century that the word acquired its
            modern definition; according to the Oxford English Dictionary, the
            first known use of the word computer was in a different sense, in a
            1613 book called The Yong Mans Gleanings by the English writer
            Richard Brathwait: "I haue [sic] read the truest computer of Times,
            and the best Arithmetician that euer [sic] breathed, and he reduceth
            thy dayes into a short number.
        </p>
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
            The history of computing is longer than the history of computing
            hardware and modern computing technology and includes the history of
            methods intended for pen and paper or for chalk and slate, with or
            without the aid of tables.
        </p>
        <h3>Pre-20th century</h3>
        <p>
            Devices have been used to aid computation for thousands of years,
            mostly using one-to-one correspondence with fingers. The earliest
            counting device was most likely a form of tally stick. Later record
            keeping aids throughout the Fertile Crescent included calculi (clay
            spheres, cones, etc.) which represented counts of items, likely
            livestock or grains, sealed in hollow unbaked clay containers.[a][4]
            The use of counting rods is one example.

        <h2>Digital computers</h2>
        <h3>Electromechanical</h3>
        <p>
            By 1938, the United States Navy had developed an electromechanical
            analog computer small enough to use aboard a submarine. This was the
            Torpedo Data Computer, which used trigonometry to solve the problem
            of firing a torpedo at a moving target. During World War II similar
            devices were developed in other countries as well.
