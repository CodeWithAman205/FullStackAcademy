            what you learn right
        </p>

            You can live dignity,<br />when you live a lifestyle that,
            <br />matches your vision.

        <h4>The Ocean</h4>
        <p>
            As I look from the edge of the ocean,<br />Gilmmering golden, for
            it's almost down,<br />So many waves coming towards going me.
        </p>
        <p>
            And I yet I know, there's a lot more going on.<br />The ocean
            stretches for miles around,<br />So many creatures with fins and
            gills,<br />So many miles below the ground.
        </p>
        <p>
            The waves are splashing closer and closer,<br />As I realise the
            world is bigger than it seems.
        </p>
        <p>
            As I stare into the ocean,<br />
            In golden light, it gleams./p>
